## **Overview**  
**Code-Snippets-Site** is dedicated to helping developers—beginners and pros—explore various **data structures** and **programming techniques**. The platform provides a **navigation bar** linking to topics like Arrays, Linked Lists, Sorting Algorithms, and more. Each topic page displays:

- **Highlighted code snippets** with brief explanations.  
- **Complexity insights** or best practices.  
- Real-world use cases where applicable.

This repository contains the **front-end**, **back-end (API)**, and **database schema** all in one place. Below, you will find **design documents**, **wireframes**, and **usage instructions**.

---

## **Features**  
- **Structured Navigation**: Quickly jump to categories like **Arrays**, **Stacks**, **Trees**, or **Sorting**.  
- **Code Highlights & Explanations**: Learn at a glance with well-formatted code and bullet-point summaries.  
- **RESTful API**: Easily expand or modify snippet content via simple endpoints.  
- **Search Functionality (Planned)**: Filter snippets by language or keyword.  
- **Community Contributions (Future)**: Allow users to add or rate snippets.

## **User Stories**
Below are **five** user stories demonstrating how different users will interact with the system:
- **As a** new developer, **I want** to browse code snippets by category, **so that I can** quickly learn about concepts I currently need to learn about.
- **As a** curious visitor, **I want** to see code snippets with explanations, **so that I can** how some code works in practice.
- **As a** developer, **I want** to have the ability to search for specific subjects, **so that I can** find specific topics or languages more easily.
- **As a** researcher, **I want** filter snippets by language, **so that I can** see examples relating to the languages I use.
- **As a** self-learner, **I want** to understand certain implementations of code and their complexities **so that I can** compare different solutions.
